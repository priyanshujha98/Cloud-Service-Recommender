The following extended requirement for the FAU class has been included in this ST because the operational environment is capable of providing security audit generation for TSF functions."
2050,"Performance should not be an issue because all of our server queries involve small pieces of data. Changing screens will require very little computation and thus will occur very quickly.

2051,SplitPay will not affect data stored outside of its servers nor will it affect any other applications installed on the userâ€™s phone. It cannot cause any damage to the phone or its internal components. The only potential safety concern associated with this application applies to virtually all handset apps: SplitPay should not be used while operating a vehicle or in any other situation where the userâ€™s attention must be focused elsewhere.
2052,"This application assumes that only the user or whoever he/she allows will have access to his/her Android handset. With that being said, only a Google email address is required to verify the identity of the user upon opening the app. Since it is not password protected, there is no method to authenticate the userâ€™s identity. This could only pose a thread if a user has set up PayPal functionality, however any transaction involving real currency must be authorized and confirmed before becoming final. The PayPal API provides all of the security checks needed to ensure that no fraudulent transactions occur."
2053,The graphical user interface of SplitPay is to be designed with usability as the first priority. The app will be presented and organized in a manner that is both visually appealing and easy for the user to navigate. There will be feedbacks and visual cues such as notifications to inform users of updates and pop-ups to provide users with instructions.
2054,"To ensure reliability and correctness, there will be zero tolerance for errors in the algorithm that computes and splits expenses between group members. To maintain flexibility and adaptability, the app will take into account situations in which a user loses internet connection or for whatever reason cannot establish a connection with the server. These users will still be able to use the application, but any Bills, transactions, etc. posted while disconnected will be cached until the connection is restored."
